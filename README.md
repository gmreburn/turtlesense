# Turtle Sense (EXPERIMENTAL)

Turtle Sense is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance your experience when working with TTL (Turtle) files, a common format used for representing RDF data. With Turtle Sense, you can enjoy IntelliSense support, syntax highlighting, and error checking/validation specifically tailored for TTL files.

## Features

Turtle Sense provides the following features:

- IntelliSense support for TTL (Turtle) files, including auto-completion for keywords, predicates, and entities. The file must be recongized as Turtle syntax through that installed language.

## Requirements

This extension will only activate when the IDE detects that a Turtle file is opened. We recommend installing [Turtle Language Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stardog-union.vscode-langserver-turtle) to help the IDE recongize the file.

## Extension Settings

This extension doesn't contribute any additional settings to VS Code.

## Known Issues

This extension is experimental. If you encounter any problems, please report them on the GitHub repository.
